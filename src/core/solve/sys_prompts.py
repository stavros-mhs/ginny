                                You'll be given a string containing a coding assignment of undergraduate level difficult from an 'Introduction to Programming' course.
                                The assignment will likely be be in C (but not neccesarilly).
                                What you have to do is summarize the goal of the assignment in a concise way so
                                that whoever's implementing it (another LLM or human) gets the gist of it.
                                Do not mention test cases or details of how to turn in the assignment.
                                Mention _explicitly_ the language in which the assignment must be written in.
                                Maybe choose 1 or 2 examples and add them.
                                In general, keep it _brief_ and _to the point_.

                                You are given the option to iterate before you turn in your summary if you believe you can make it better.
